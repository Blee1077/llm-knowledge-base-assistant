1. Introduction
The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to provide guidance on the standards of behavior expected of all employees at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. ("Dunder Mifflin" or the "Company"). It is the responsibility of each employee to uphold these standards and contribute to a positive work environment. We encourage everyone to have a sense of humor while maintaining professionalism, as we believe that a fun work atmosphere fosters creativity and productivity.

2. Core Values
The following core values serve as the foundation for our company culture and guide our daily operations:

a. Integrity: We act honestly, ethically, and responsibly in all aspects of our work, even when nobody's watching, especially when Dwight is involved.

b. Respect: We treat our colleagues, customers, and business partners with dignity and courtesy, remembering that everyone deserves a second chance, just like Michael Scott after his "Diversity Day" presentation.

c. Teamwork: We collaborate and support one another to achieve our goals, knowing that together we can accomplish more, like Jim and Pam's iconic office pranks.

d. Excellence: We strive for the highest quality in our products, services, and performance, always seeking to deliver the "World's Best" paper products, just like our "World's Best Boss" coffee mug.

3. Ethical Conduct
Employees are expected to:
a. Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and company policies, because nobody wants to end up like Creed on Halloween.

b. Avoid any actions that may harm the reputation or financial interests of Dunder Mifflin, so please refrain from starting a fire in the office to make a statement about safety procedures.

c. Report any suspected violations of law, regulation, or company policy to a supervisor or the Human Resources Department, as long as it's not about the Party Planning Committee, in which case please report directly to Angela.

4. Professionalism
Employees are expected to:
a. Maintain a professional appearance and demeanor in the workplace, but feel free to express your personal style, like Michael Scott's unforgettable jeans-and-suit-jacket combo.

b. Communicate respectfully and effectively with colleagues, customers, and business partners, even if you find yourself in a meeting that could've been an email or another one of Michael's "mandatory fun" events.

c. Take responsibility for their work, meet deadlines, and actively seek opportunities for improvement, because the only thing worse than missing a deadline is being stuck in an endless loop of conference room meetings about missed deadlines.

5. Diversity and Inclusion
Dunder Mifflin is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, where everyone feels welcome, even if their favorite pastime is beet farming. We value and respect the unique backgrounds, perspectives, and talents of our employees. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other protected status is strictly prohibited, and we're determined to make our office more inclusive than the "Finer Things Club."

6. Conflict of Interest
Employees must avoid situations that may create or appear to create a conflict between their personal interests and the interests of the company. This includes, but is not limited to, accepting gifts or favors from customers or suppliers, or engaging in outside employment that may interfere with their job duties at Dunder Mifflin. If you're considering starting a side business like "Serenity by Jan" or "Schrute Farms," please consult with HR first.

7. Confidentiality and Data Privacy
Employees must protect confidential and sensitive information pertaining to Dunder Mifflin, its employees, customers, and business partners. This includes safeguarding customer data, following security protocols, and adhering to data privacy regulations. Always remember that it's essential to protect the secret recipe for Kevin's famous chili and any other confidential information. Just like you wouldn't want everyone to know about Jim's teapot letter to Pam, it's crucial to keep sensitive data under wraps.

8. Health and Safety
Dunder Mifflin is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. Employees are responsible for following all safety procedures, reporting hazards, and using appropriate protective equipment when necessary. When participating in Office Olympics, please ensure you follow safety guidelines and avoid hazardous activities like "Flonkerton" or anything involving a George Foreman Grill.

9. Anti-harassment and Discrimination
Dunder Mifflin has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination. All employees are expected to treat others with respect and dignity. Any form of harassment or discrimination, whether verbal, physical, or visual, is strictly prohibited and will be subject to disciplinary action. Remember, Toby is part of HR, which technically means he works for corporate, so he's not a part of our family â€“ but that's still no excuse to treat him poorly.

10. Reporting and Compliance
Employees are encouraged to report any concerns, issues, or violations of this Code of Conduct to their supervisor, the Human Resources Department, or through the company's anonymous reporting system. Dunder Mifflin is committed to investigating all reports promptly and fairly, and will not tolerate retaliation against any employee for making a good-faith report. However, be advised that reports about Dwight's hidden weapons stash may be met with skepticism.

11. Acknowledgment and Acceptance
All employees are required to read and acknowledge their understanding of and agreement to adhere to the Dunder Mifflin Code of Conduct. This acknowledgment should be signed and returned to the Human Resources Department upon receipt of the document. As a token of appreciation, all employees who return their signed acknowledgment will be entered into a raffle for a chance to win a "World's Best Employee" Dundie Award.

Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Disciplinary action will be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the severity of the violation, the employee's past performance, and any other relevant factors. If you find yourself in a "Scott's Tots" situation, expect consequences.
