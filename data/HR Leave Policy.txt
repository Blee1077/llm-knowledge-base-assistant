1. Introduction
The purpose of this Leave Policy is to provide employees at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. ("Dunder Mifflin" or the "Company") with information about the various types of leave available and the procedures for requesting leave. This policy is designed to ensure that employees can take time away from work as needed while maintaining a healthy work-life balance and meeting their personal and professional obligations. Just like Michael's World's Best Boss mug, we want our leave policy to be full of substance and good intentions.

2. Vacation Leave
2.1. Accrual and Carryover
Full-time employees are eligible for vacation leave, which accrues on a monthly basis. The amount of vacation leave accrued depends on the employee's length of service with the company. To avoid the "Vacation Days that Never Were" syndrome, please be mindful of using your vacation days within the calendar year, as unused days will not carry over.

2.2. Vacation Leave Approval and Scheduling
Employees are encouraged to request vacation leave well in advance to help supervisors and managers plan for absences and ensure adequate coverage during the employee's time off. Keep in mind that submitting vacation leave requests during the annual Office Olympics is frowned upon.

3. Sick Leave
3.1. Sick Leave Usage
In addition to using sick leave for the employee's own illness, sick leave can be used for the care of an immediate family member or to attend medical appointments. We trust that you won't be using sick leave for your own personal Dundie Awards ceremony.

4. Public Holidays
4.1. Floating Holidays
In addition to the standard public holidays, Dunder Mifflin provides two floating holidays per year for full-time employees. These floating holidays can be used at the employee's discretion, with supervisor approval.

5. Parental Leave
5.1. Additional Parental Leave
In addition to the standard parental leave, Dunder Mifflin also offers an additional four weeks of unpaid leave for employees who have exhausted their paid parental leave, providing a total of 16 weeks of leave for eligible employees.

6. Bereavement Leave
6.1. Extended Bereavement Leave
In cases where an employee needs to travel or requires additional time to cope with the loss of an immediate family member, they may request up to two additional days of unpaid bereavement leave.

7. Jury Duty and Court Appearances
7.1. Court-Related Leave
Employees who are subpoenaed or summoned to appear in court for reasons unrelated to jury duty, such as a witness in a trial or a party in a legal proceeding, are eligible for up to three days of unpaid leave.

8. Unpaid Leave
8.1. Personal Leave
Dunder Mifflin recognizes that employees may occasionally need to take time away from work for personal reasons not covered by other types of leave. In such cases, employees may request up to four weeks of unpaid personal leave, subject to approval by their supervisor and the Human Resources Department.

9. Leave Request and Approval Process
9.1. Required Notice
Employees must provide at least two weeks' notice for vacation leave and as soon as possible for other types of leave. If you're planning to elope with your office crush à la Jim and Pam, we'd appreciate a heads-up.

10. Work from Home during Leave
10.1. Partial-day Work from Home
In cases where an employee may need to attend to personal matters but does not require a full day of leave, Dunder Mifflin allows the option to work from home for a partial day, with supervisor approval. This ensures that employees can address their personal needs while still contributing to the company's goals. Please note that working from home does not grant immunity from office pranks, but it does provide a temporary reprieve.

11. Leave Donation Program
11.1. Voluntary Leave Donation
Dunder Mifflin encourages employees to support one another during difficult times. As part of this commitment, the company offers a voluntary leave donation program, allowing employees to donate a portion of their accrued vacation or sick leave to a leave pool. This pool can be used by employees who have exhausted their own leave balances due to serious illness or other qualifying circumstances. Participation in the program is entirely voluntary and helps foster a sense of camaraderie and support among our employees. Just like Michael Scott's famous "That's what she said" jokes, our leave donation program is all about the spirit of giving.

12. Leave for Professional Development
12.1. Training and Education Leave
Dunder Mifflin values the professional growth of its employees and offers up to five days of paid leave per year for employees to attend job-related training, workshops, or conferences. This leave must be approved by the employee's supervisor and should be directly related to the employee's current job or a position they may reasonably attain within the company. While attending "The Michael Scott School of Business" is not an approved training program, we do encourage employees to seek out reputable educational opportunities.

13. Military Leave
13.1. Military Service Leave
Dunder Mifflin supports employees who serve in the National Guard or Reserve and provides up to two weeks of paid military leave per year. This leave can be used for annual training or other required military duties. The company will also comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to employees who are called to active duty.

14. Policy Compliance
14.1. Unauthorized Leave
Taking unauthorized leave may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. We encourage open communication between employees and their supervisors to avoid any misunderstandings about leave requests.

By providing a comprehensive and fair Leave Policy, Dunder Mifflin aims to create a supportive work environment where employees can thrive and contribute to the company's success while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We believe that fostering a positive atmosphere not only helps employees manage their personal and professional lives but also contributes to increased productivity and workplace satisfaction. After all, a happy employee is a productive employee – even when faced with a prank or two from their colleagues.
