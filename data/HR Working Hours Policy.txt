4. Breaks

Employees are entitled to two paid 15-minute rest breaks per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Rest breaks should be taken at a time that minimizes disruption to the employee's work and the operations of the company.

5. Timekeeping

Employees are required to clock in and out using the company's timekeeping system at the beginning and end of their workday, as well as when taking lunch breaks. Accurate timekeeping is essential for ensuring compliance with labor laws and regulations and for calculating employee compensation, including overtime pay.

5.2 Timekeeping Accuracy

Employees are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of their recorded work hours. Any discrepancies or errors should be reported to the employee's supervisor and the Human Resources Department as soon as possible for correction.

7. Overtime Compensation
7.1 Overtime Rate

Non-exempt employees will be compensated for overtime work at a rate of one and a half times their regular hourly rate for any hours worked beyond 40 hours in a workweek. Overtime pay will be calculated based on the employee's actual hours worked and will be paid in the next regular payroll period.
