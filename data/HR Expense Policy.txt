1. Introduction
The purpose of this Expense Policy is to outline the guidelines and procedures for the handling of business expenses incurred by employees at Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. ("Dunder Mifflin" or the "Company"). This policy covers expenses related to business trips, team events, and other authorized business activities. It is intended to ensure that employees are reimbursed fairly and promptly for necessary and reasonable expenses, while also maintaining appropriate financial controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Remember, a penny saved is a penny earned, so let's save those pennies for our World's Best Boss mugs!

2. Authorized Business Expenses
Dunder Mifflin will reimburse employees for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the course of conducting company business, including, but not limited to:

2.1. Travel expenses
These may include airfare, train tickets, car rental, and taxi fares. However, private jet rentals or first-class upgrades need to be approved by Michael Scott himself (good luck with that).

2.2. Accommodation expenses
These may include hotel rooms or other temporary lodging. Employees are encouraged to find the best deals, as long as it's not the "Fawlty Towers."

2.3. Meal expenses
Subject to daily limits established by the company, but don't worry - we won't leave you hungry like a wolf (or a rabid dog from the warehouse).

2.4. Business-related entertainment expenses
These may include client dinners or team-building events, with prior approval from a supervisor or manager. Bear in mind that "team-building events" do not include a trip to Jamaica with Jan.

2.5. Conference and seminar registration fees
Because learning is essential, and so is pretending to listen to speakers while you're daydreaming about Pretzel Day.

2.6. Office supplies and materials
These are required for business purposes. Remember, though, that 500 reams of paper for a personal origami collection are not considered a business purpose.

Personal expenses, such as room service, in-room movies, or personal telephone calls, are not eligible for reimbursement and must be paid by the employee. No, we will not cover your addiction to Schrute Bucks.

3. Expense Approval and Reimbursement Process
To request reimbursement for authorized business expenses, employees must follow these steps (like Creed chasing a squirrel):

3.1. Obtain prior approval
For significant expenses or events, employees should obtain prior approval from their supervisor or manager before incurring the expense. You know what they say, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" - or in this case, a pound of paper.

3.2. Complete an expense report
Employees must submit a completed expense report, along with all required documentation, to their supervisor or manager for review and approval. Expense reports should be submitted within 30 days of incurring the expense or returning from a business trip. After 30 days, it's like Kevin's famous chili - spilled and gone.

3.3. Supervisor or manager review
The employee's supervisor or manager will review the expense report for accuracy, compliance with the Expense Policy, and availability of funds. If approved, the expense report will be forwarded to the Finance Department for processing - faster than Toby can ruin a good time.

3.4. Reimbursement
The Finance Department will process the approved expense report and issue reimbursement to the employee, typically through direct deposit or a company-issued check. Just remember, Angela isn't responsible for any math mistakes.

4. Documentation Requirements
Employees must provide original receipts, invoices, or other proof of payment for all expenses claimed for reimbursement. For meal and entertainment expenses, employees should also include a brief description of the business purpose and the names of attendees. It's like show and tell, but with receipts instead of a pet rock.

4.1. Lost or unavailable documentation
In the event that original documentation is lost or unavailable (we're looking at you, Creed), employees should provide a written explanation and obtain approval from their supervisor or manager before submitting the expense report. Remember, "the dog ate my receipt" won't fly here.

5. Expense Reimbursement Timeline
Dunder Mifflin aims to process expense reimbursements within 14 business days of receiving an approved expense report and all required documentation. Employees should ensure that their expense reports are submitted promptly and include all necessary information to avoid delays in reimbursement. We'll get your money to you faster than you can say "Assistant Regional Manager" (or was it "Assistant to the Regional Manager"?).

6. Corporate Credit Cards
In some cases, employees may be issued a corporate credit card for use in connection with authorized business expenses. Employees who are issued a corporate credit card must adhere to the company's Corporate Credit Card Policy, which outlines the appropriate use, reporting, and repayment requirements.

6.1. Authorized use
Remember, a corporate credit card is not for purchasing Dundie Awards or a lifetime supply of "World's Best Boss" mugs.

6.2. Reporting
Employees must report all transactions made with the corporate credit card and provide the necessary documentation as if they were submitting an expense report. No sneaky business here!

6.3. Repayment
Any personal or unauthorized charges made using the corporate credit card must be repaid immediately. Failure to do so may result in the revocation of your corporate credit card privileges and potential disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. It's like Michael says, "Fool me once, strike one. Fool me twice, strike three."

7. Policy Compliance
All employees are responsible for adhering to this Expense Policy and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with this policy or any expense procedures may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any concerns or issues related to expenses or reimbursements should be reported to the employee's supervisor, manager, or the Human Resources Department for investigation and resolution.

7.1. Monitoring and audits
Dunder Mifflin reserves the right to monitor expense reports and perform random audits to ensure compliance with this policy. So, don't try to pass off that "Office Olympics" medal as a legitimate expense!

By following this Expense Policy, employees can ensure that business expenses are managed in a transparent, fair, and efficient manner. Dunder Mifflin is committed to supporting employees in their work-related activities and reimbursing them for necessary and reasonable expenses incurred in the course of conducting company business. Employees are encouraged to exercise good judgment and seek guidance from their supervisor or manager if they have any questions or concerns about the appropriateness of an expense or the reimbursement process. And remember, we're all in this together - like a big, happy, paper-selling family!
